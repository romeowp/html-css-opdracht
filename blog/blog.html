            Megami Tensei is a franchise a many games and spin-offs. The series began with a series of novels written by
            Aya Nishitani, the first of which is Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei. The franchise has crossed many
            consoles and genres, and is the third most popular Japanese RPG franchise in existence. Although less
            popular, Megami Tensei or simply called "Megaten" by fans, contains more games and spin-offs than almost any
            other franchise.

        <p>
            Shin Megami Tensei (真・女神転生; lit. True Goddess Reincarnation) is the first game in the Shin Megami Tensei
            series of games developed by Atlus Co., Ltd.. The game has been remade for multiple platforms and several of
            its features have heavily influenced other Megami Tensei spin-offs. All the versions of the game have been
            distributed by Atlus, with the exception of the Mega-CD/Sega CD version which was distributed by Sims.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shin Megami Tensei II (真・女神転生 II; lit. True Goddess Reincarnation II) is the second installment in the Shin
            Megami Tensei series. It was released for the Super Famicom on March 18, 1994 in Japan. It was later remade
            for the PlayStation in 2002, and then for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. It is a role-playing video game
            that, similar to most of the games in the series, encourages the player to persuade demons to join the main
            characters battle party.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne (真・女神転生III-NOCTURNE; literally True Goddess Reincarnation III-NOCTURNE) is
            the third installment in the Shin Megami Tensei series, released for the PlayStation 2. The setting features
            a post-apocalyptic, demon-infested world, which is in the brink of rebirth; called the Conception. It was
            the first true addition to the main series since the original Super Famicom release of Shin Megami Tensei II
            on March 18th, 1994. As such, one can understand the magnitude of releasing a sequel nearly a decade later.
            Nocturne was highly anticipated and met with good sales upon its release.

            Currently, there is no official English release of Shin Megami Tensei. On 30 June, 2002, Aeon Genesis
            released an English translation patch for the Super Famicom version of the game. On 30 September, 2012,
            Orden released a fix for the patch. This makes the law route playable without crashing, changes some names
            to fit the width of the system and official Atlus translations better.[2]
